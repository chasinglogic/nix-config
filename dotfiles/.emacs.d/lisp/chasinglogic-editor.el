  ;; Font
  ;;     First set the font. I've tried many fonts in my time and I find
  ;;     Source Code Pro to be a Pretty Good Fontâ„¢. Other fonts I like are
  ;;     Inconsolata and DejaVu Sans Mono, and one day I may switch back to
  ;;     them but getting them on all platforms can be a hassle.
  ;;     The only thing fancy about the way this font is getting set is that
  ;;     I use two font sizes: one for my Mac because of the retina display
  ;;     and one for everything else where I use regular monitors.
  (setq-default chasinglogic-font-size "10")
  (when (and (display-graphic-p) (eq system-type 'darwin))
    ;; Retina display requires bigger font IMO.
    (setq chasinglogic-font-size "15"))

  ;; Faster than set-frame-font
  (setq chasinglogic-font (format "Fira Code-%s" chasinglogic-font-size))
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist (cons 'font chasinglogic-font))

  ;; Window Chrome
  ;;     Emacs by default has lots of window chrome to make it more mouse
  ;;     accessible. While I actually use my mouse quite a bit and love
  ;;     Emacs mouse integration I really hate big UI elements and I never
  ;;     use the mouse for the operations available in this chrome. These
  ;;     mode disable lines remove all of this chrome so it's just Me, My
  ;;     Buffer, and I.

  ;; On MacOS there's a new feature to have title bars match the window
  ;; they belong to. This makes Emacs do that so the title bar looks
  ;; like it's part of the buffer.

  ;; Line numbers in programming modes.
  ;;     I enable line numbers using the new Emacs 26
  ;;     `display-line-numbers-mode' for all text major modes.

  ;; Automatically maximize Emacs frames when they are created
  ;;     This is a custom function I wrote that maximizes the frame it's
  ;;     passed. I then hook it into the `after-make-frame-functions' hook
  ;;     so any time a frame is created it is maximized.

;; Color Theme

;;   I change this too often to really document why whatever
;;   theme I'm in the mood for is the one I'm in the mood for.
