;; Font
;;     First set the font. I've tried many fonts in my time and I find
;;     Source Code Pro to be a Pretty Good Fontâ„¢. Other fonts I like are
;;     Inconsolata and DejaVu Sans Mono, and one day I may switch back to
;;     them but getting them on all platforms can be a hassle.
;;     The only thing fancy about the way this font is getting set is that
;;     I use two font sizes: one for my Mac because of the retina display
;;     and one for everything else where I use regular monitors.
(setq-default chasinglogic-font-size "11")
(when (eq system-type 'darwin)
  ;; Retina display requires bigger font IMO.

;; Window Chrome
;;     Emacs by default has lots of window chrome to make it more mouse
;;     accessible. While I actually use my mouse quite a bit and love
;;     Emacs mouse integration I really hate big UI elements and I never
;;     use the mouse for the operations available in this chrome. These
;;     mode disable lines remove all of this chrome so it's just Me, My
;;     Buffer, and I.

;; they belong to. This makes Emacs do that so the title bar looks
;; like it's part of the buffer.

;; Automatically maximize Emacs frames when they are created
;;     This is a custom function I wrote that maximizes the frame it's

;; One of the best features of Emacs is it's ability to integrate
;; with programming languages at a syntactic level. It enables you to
;; really edit these languages at that level in some
;; cases. One of the common tasks that it can automate is commenting
;; and uncommenting text in a source file. Unfortunately the default
;; function for this `comment-dwim' assumes that if you have no
;; region you want to insert a line comment. I rarely if ever use
;; line comments and would prefer it to instead comment out the
;; current line if no region is selected so I wrote
;; `comment-actually-dwim' that does this and overwrite the default
;; `comment-dwim' keybinding with my version.

simply calls `comment-or-uncomment-region' with the current line

to manage comments at the end of lines. I rarely do on line
comments so this function better suits my needs."
